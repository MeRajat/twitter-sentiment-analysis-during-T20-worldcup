Want @OfficialSLC to bat well. Don't want the scorecard to go lyk 1/1 , 2/2, 3/3. Really, Its quite frustrating! #INDvsSL #IndvSL #AsiaCup
Make 150 our bowlers will take care rest of the match :) #INDvsSL ehema neda? @daniel86cricket @AKSCOOP6 @rukhshan
Restricting SL Between 140-150 @BCCI will be a good Score to Chase!! #INDvsSL #AsiaCupT20 @StarSportsIndia All the Best #MenInBlue

The game is on bitch.. #INDvsSL
India have now won the toss 3 times in 4 T20Is. They had won only one in their previous 13 T20Is. #IndvsSL #AsiaCupT20
India should've batted first to have some batting practice. #INDvsSL
We really need to work on our finishing. Both in batting & bowling. No one to rely on. Awaiting to see @YUVSTRONG12 #AusVsInd
James Faulkner inflicting some serious damage in the end https://t.co/5pJqhMgF19 #IndvsAus

Jadeja is good for nothing. U have to understand captain @msdhoni lot of other deserving player are waiting in India.. #IndvsAus
Why sran is digging in short every single ball???? Dhoni why are u not telling youngster??#IndvsAus
Shikhar dhawan seems to be the most responsible Player of Indian cricket team. He is always responsible for a bad start. #IndvsAus
Shikhar dhawan disappears from crease faster than Mr. India #IndVsAus
Impact of kejri's even-odd is such that even team india can't avoid it Match 1: 309/3 Match 2: 308/8 #IndvsAus
Rohit Sharma is that General Category Student who performs extremely well when in abroad. #IndvsAus
Back to back century by hit man. Will century ends with wining side. #IndvsAus
Good over by Barinder Sran, Australia 19/0 after 3 overs ‚Äî https://t.co/PRYWBTPoyD #AUSvIND #INDvsAUS
