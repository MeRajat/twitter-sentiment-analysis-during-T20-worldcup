Indian middle order is full of experienced big hitters. I don't think they will face any difficulty to chase this total. #AsiaCup #IndvsSL
#INDvsSL Who took the catch of Rohit Sharma?? SRK #Fan would be like K..K..K.. Kapudegera..😀😂

5 star from virat kholi 😀#INDvsSL
End of Over 6(Powerplay) : @BCCI 25-2 #INDvsSL #AsiaCupt20
@imVkohli #INDvsSL sheer delight to watch
Rohit 'Lazy' Sharma! He too lazy to use his 'talent' to play shot. #INDvsSL
That shot is why Kohli is my favourite batsman in the Indian team. #INDvsSL #AsiaCupT20
Kohli typically confident while Raina still finding his feet as India are 37-2 after the end of powerplay overs. #INDvsSL #AsiaCupT20
Raina gone!! Pick up two or three more.It's getting boring. #INDvsSL #AsiaCupT20
Kulasekara makes an easy catch look difficult but takes it eventually. Raina departs for 25. India 70-3 after 11.1 overs. #INDvsSL
I'm curious to see Virat Kohli getting out so I can find out what mistake he makes with that sort of technique and form. #INDvsSL
Bad time to get out!! Will this be the turning point?? #IndvsSL #AsiaCupT20
#INDvsSL WICKET! Raina mistimes and Kulasekara juggles, but completes the catch. India 70/3 Live:
Yuviiiiiii #INDvsSL #AsiaCup
#INDvsSL Dasun Shanaka to Raina, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!! 25(26) [4s-2] #AsiaCupT20
Love is fake!
#INDvsSL raina out
22 millions hearts stopped for few seconds there! #SLvsIND #INDvsSL #AsiaCup
Well said @RusselArnold69. Shuld have gone upstairs wen #Thisaraperera was batting as well. He wuld hve scored atleast 15 runs more #INDvsSL
Lankans get it at the right time!!! #INDvsSL
Only for a true cricket lover How many ways are there to get out in cricket ? If a Girl can reply correctly to this Marry her #INDvsSL
#IndVsSL Chances less to win ind dis match raina out🙆🙆🙆
If #Kohli wins this, my money's on him (which I've yet to earn) #INDvsSL
Each and every Aggressive Shot of Virat Kohli is loudly saying.... ,, "Go to Hell Anushka" 󾌴 󾌴󾌴 #INDvsSL - Sri Ram — feeling crazy
I'd better stop checking the score, that's also jinxing them. #IndvsSL #AsiaCupT20
Virat is playing like its a BATTING pitch...but everybody knows how dangerous the pitch is. 🙏🙏 #INDvsSL #KohliLegend

Shikhar Dhawan paid a tribute to Shahid Afridi on his birthday. #IndvsSL
Raina goes for 25 and India now 70/3, A big wicket for Sri Lanka. #INDvsSL #AsiaCupT20
#INDvsSL One day a spaceship will come & take back Virat Kohli to his planet?

Virat Kohli - Man of the Match Anushka Sharma - Exwoman of the Match #INDvsSL

Maybe, Shikhar Dhawan was afraid of being sued by Baba's bhakts for playing too many "shots" #IndvsAus 2nd ODI
It ll be easy If India starts innings with 9 wickets. BCoz howevr Dhawan gets out in 1st ovr at least we cld reduce his effort. #IndvsAus
Did anyone hear Virat saying BC, MC to S Dhawan while leaving the ground #IndvsAus
What has Bhuvi done to get dropped. He bowled brilliantly on a dead pitch!😐 unlike other bowlers.👊🏻😎😉#cricket #AUSvIND #IndvsAus #ODI
Partnership between RO and Virat guarantee a Big Score. #IndvsAus #BleedBlue
#cricket #AUSvsIND IND: 38/1 (7.0 Ovs) Rohit Sharma* : 21/21 Virat Kohli : 10/17 Kane Richardson*:3-1-19-0
@BCCI It's high time now. Shikhar Dhawan should be sacked from the team. Ajinkya should open and Raina/Yuvraj can play in mid. #IndvsAus
There are like two Indian cricket grounds inside this Gabba. Huge! #IndvsAus
@ImRo45 &@imVkohli again for #Ind , Hope for the best . Come on #TeamIndia #BleedBlue #brisbane @BCCI #IndvsAus
My Driver went out to bat today - Shikhar Dhawan #IndvsAus

After marriage your luck is directly proportional to your partner's luck and Rohit Sharma's consistency prove this point. #IndvsAus
WTF commentary is when rohit sharma make 171 it's a marvel and when #Australia returns the marvel and won #India bowled bad #IndvsAus
Shikhar Dhawan is the most consistent batsman of india #IndvsAus
Meanwhile,in 2nd ODI ,Indian bowlers already practicing hard in the nets to CTRL+Z all good work done by Kohli & Rohit :P #IndvsAus #indvaus
Wht a shot @ImRo45 SIX - Shot of the day so far Short of length outside off stump, Pulled over mid-wicket a flat SIX of Richardson #IndvsAus

Soo much sucking up for Indian Cricket from Star Sport Commentary Team..!! Specially from Non-Indians !!! #AUSvsIND

Second match and two hundreds already in the series. Wonderful! #RohitSharma #Hitman #IndvsAus
Fantastic knock by Rohit Sharma! Just amazing to watch when in full flow. #IndvsAus
Bak to bak hits by hitman #Rohit #IndVsAus
though he took 18 balls to convert 90 to 100 ... 2nd consecutive hundred for #RohitSharma well batted #IndvsAus
Two Back to Back TON's in Australia. What an Incredible Achievement for Rohit 🙌🙌👏👏 #IndvsAus
Only 100 left for 200 #Rohit #IndvsAus 😊😊🙌🙌
10th ODI hundred looks like his 30th, Rohit Sharma! #Respect #IndvsAus
100 for #RohitSharma, India 203/2 https://t.co/KdzLizqZNC #IndvsAus
Rohit just hit his 10th odi century; 5th against Australia😭😭😭 #IndvsAus
Another ton from Rohit comes up. Amazing batting! Consecutive tons. Going well! Now pace up the attack! #IndvsAus
Another one for Rohit Sharma. 10th ODI 100 & 5th vs Australia. Great Knock. #IndvsAus #AUSvsIND

Sharma ji ka ladka outperforming Indian team. Congratulations. #IndvsAus
#IndvsAus And here it comes once again 100 for #RohitSharma .... Congrtss @ImRo45 !!!
"Nervous 90s" is a crap which is associated with Indian batsmen only. You never hear the same for Aussies or Kiwis or proteas!! #IndvsAus
Hahaha even the commentators know @ImRo45 loves Australia 😂😂😂 #IndvsAus
Rohit Sharma completes his 100 off 111 balls. That is his 4th in Australia, 5th vs the Aussies! #INDvsAUS #AUSvIND https://t.co/Q2r3G8aDL1
Another great ton by #Hitman ! Unbelievable #IndvsAus — watching India vs Australia
Lets start a campaign #wedontneeddhoni #IndvsAus #AUSvIND
As usual play for yourself. Make centuries. Then let India loose. So typical. #IndvsAus #rohit
India really need @ImRaina or @YUVSTRONG12 in lower middle order. Seems No other can score faster in last 5 overs. #IndvsAus #disappointed
Very unfortunate for Rahane to miss out on his century..well played fella. #IndvsAus #AUSvIND #Cricket #Brisbane #Gabba #India #Rahane
@India_AllSports @rohanbopanna RT it: #INDvsAUS Match under suspicion hint of Fixing-> https://t.co/Bli1HzecYz
need 15 runs from last over. #AUSvsIND
So Dhoni is not trying new players as they are not finished products.All The hard work done by top order will go down drain again #IndvsAus
Last over to go, should make the most out of it! #AusvsInd
So long as Mr suspect fixer is captain of the bcci team, will root for the other team to win. Go Aussies. #IndvsAus
With back-to-back centuries in the first 2 ODIs against Australia, @ImRo45 is the in-form man for India! #IndvsAus https://t.co/xButVoJwTL
Again we are 20-30 runs short of a winning total on this pitch :( #IndvsAus
Keep wondering why @SDhawan25 is still getting a chance in the team after consecutive failures. #AusvsInd @BCCI
Well played @ImRo45 - @imVkohli - @ajinkyarahane88 #IndvsAus
Rahane is more entertaining than Rohit. If not more entertaining then atleast more consistent!! #AUSvIND #IndvsAus
We really need to work on our finishing. Both in batting & bowling. No one to rely on. Awaiting to see @YUVSTRONG12 #AusVsInd
James Faulkner inflicting some serious damage in the end https://t.co/5pJqhMgF19 #IndvsAus
We will lose again :/ #IndvsAus
The Great Indian Collapse #IndvsAus
Absolutely brilliant bowling by #Aus. They are mixing the pace smartly.👏🏻👍🏻😎😉#cricket #AUSvIND #IndvsAus #ODI
Jadeja is good for nothing. U have to understand captain @msdhoni lot of other deserving player are waiting in India.. #IndvsAus
Why sran is digging in short every single ball???? Dhoni why are u not telling youngster??#IndvsAus
Shikhar dhawan seems to be the most responsible Player of Indian cricket team. He is always responsible for a bad start. #IndvsAus
Shikhar dhawan disappears from crease faster than Mr. India #IndVsAus
Impact of kejri's even-odd is such that even team india can't avoid it Match 1: 309/3 Match 2: 308/8 #IndvsAus
Rohit Sharma is that General Category Student who performs extremely well when in abroad. #IndvsAus
Back to back century by hit man. Will century ends with wining side. #IndvsAus
Good over by Barinder Sran, Australia 19/0 after 3 overs — https://t.co/PRYWBTPoyD #AUSvIND #INDvsAUS
The frustration level of the Australian team because of Rohit Sharma reminds of VVS laxman's era. #IndvsAus
@wasimakramlive commentry cum coaching is delighting for everyone on TV #IndvsAus #icclive #starsports
Look like Aus chase this in 46over against Indian horor bowling Attack.#AusvsInd
Barinder Sran is a bowler with no variations. He's all about Military pace & shot pitched deliveries. #IndvsAus #AUSvIND
DRS is a big problem! 😂😂 #IndvsAus https://t.co/EfkKG1CFWX
India Couldn't Really Make Enough Of What They'd Maintained/Carved Upto 40th Over Of The Inning! Congrats To Rohit,Rahane&VK Tho! #IndVsAus
If @ImIshant & @imjadeja would have born in Australia then all they could have been are the ground staff #IndvsAus
there should be two Rohit (@ImRo45 ) in Indian team to reach a good score :P #IndvsAus
Drinks break! How often we see a wicket fall after drinks. @ReynoldRV9 #IndvsAus #BleedBlue
star sports realised that the victory factor % dose not apply on Indian bowling #indvsaus
Someone is on fire @ImRo45 !! Bravo !! Win Tickets to #IndvsAus!! Register and hit #mymatch now: https://t.co/hPEv9Es8ew
Easy chase for australia !! its going to be 2-0 #IndvsAus
Dear Shaun Marsh you perform well or not but after David Warner's return you cant find a place in the team :P - Steven Smith #IndvsAus
Sources has confirmed that Ishant Sharma is included in the team so that he can be blamed later for the loss.😂😂 #IndvsAus
This happens when you Make turning pitch in india... Your bowlers become Impotent on foreign land. #IndvsAus #RohitSharma #IshantSharma
#IndvsAus If MSD is not captain then he deserve place in team? at present match winner n good captain in papers only
Shaun marsh never disappoint don't know y he'e been always in n out #IndvsAus
While one Sharma is having the time of his life, the other one can't seem to get anything right #IndvsAus
#IndvsAus India is going to win the match !!! A big ground, fours and sixes tough to get, Indian bowlers doing good in limiting d boundaries
Indian : we have rohit sharma Australian : we have ishant sharma #IndvsAus
Ishant Sharma get ready for the tweets... dropping a catch is not acceptable 🙇 #IndvsAus
Another century partnership for @imro45 - virat.kohli Duo #AusVsInd #RohitWorld https://t.co/4N38JR55zQ
Everybody is so busy with #PakvsNZ that no body is noticing 18+ content going on in #IndvsAus and our neighbours are victims again 😜
Lets see who repeats themselves from last match India's bowling or Smith n Bailey. #IndvsAus
Bad performance, Poor bowling & 3 drop catches in a ODI innings enough to lose a match. We don't deserves a win. Shame!! #IndvsAus
Good ball #IndvsAus
I hate Steven Smith #IndvsAus
I wud love to see Sran - Shami opening with Bhuvi bowling in the middle overs.. Might me perfect Trio for us #IndvsAus
You think we have that much of runs that we are giving no balls .. #IndvsAus
Smith is set #IndvsAus
Lol Steven Smith Trolled 😂😂 Sran 👏👏👏 #IndvsAus
I've seen speed addicts standing on ant's nests fidget less than Steve Smith. #IndvsAus
What a Shot George!!! #IndvsAus
Bailey and Smith will take this away easily #IndvsAus
Cheeekuuuuuuu Great Catch Baby @imVkohli Awesome Fielding. #INDvsAUS
#IndvsAus FREE HIT BALL was a WIDE FULL TOSS & smith could only get a single.... Hahaha
Both openers of Australia got out after making 71 each ..Perfect tribute to #OddEvenFormula on an odd date #IndvsAus
straight over bowler's head Four shot Bailey #AusvsInd
Again a four shitttt #IndvsAus
India is struggling and bowlers re having tough time. Poor India. #AUSvsIND
Poor Rohit Sharma, another wonderful ton from him going to be in vain. #IndvsAus
India heading towards a well deserved defeat. #IndvsAus
Being unorthodox has to be selection criteria from now on. #IndvsAus
Ishant sharma perfect ex of useless bowler in odi #bcci #IndvsAus
Atleast give Rohit sharma a man of the match award yaaarrr. #IndvsAus
George Bailey now easily take this match to WIN #IndvsAus #PakvsNZ poor India cant defend total above 300 ....
India: Down Under...Down Under #IndvsAus
You know your team is in trouble when Ishant Sharma has the best figures. #IndvsAus
All efforts in vain😑👎🏻 #IndvsAus
8 wides from Ishant & he is the senior bowler of india. #IndvsAus
Rohit sharma constantly stepping towards to be a next sachin tendulkar. #IndvsAus
I was told not to post anything during the match to jinx the outcome....I stopped myself.....still the same result :( #IndvsAus
@BCCI worlds best wide baller is #ishantsharma #IndvsAus
India should really beat Australia now :/ #IndvsAus
@ESPNcricinfo how much we run needed to defend??? such a embarassment for bowlers..#AUSvsIND
Full marks to the Indian Batsmen. But there was negative marking too: Indian Bowlers #IndvsAus
India still follows the same rule when i used to watch cricket like no other game and they are still pathetic.. #IndvsAus
Improper death bowling, poor fielding, lack of penetration in middle overs, not so great captaincy..brings downfall of for INDIA..#IndvsAus
So proved that Ravi Ashwin not a complete bowler when he goes out of sub continent.. #IndvsAus
Hey team India, there's a big in your update and its called Ishant Sharma.. Please fix it soon #IndvsAus
#Ishant still got the ability to change the course of the match...!! P. S benefiting to Aussie..!! #IndvsAus
#IndvsAus stupid lazy useless Indian bowlers!!! How embarrassing when you have almost 100 million bowlers waiting for a chance
What hopes in life I have. Still sitting in front of the TV thinking India will win. Hahaha #IndvsAus
Ishant Sharma rather than scolding the batsmen by telling bahenchod should concentrate on his line #IndvsAus
8 Wides in one match . Brilliant Comeback ! @ImIshant #IndvsAus
#IndvsAus A tour to Australia would just be the perfect set up to demoralise India before the world T20.
So now Ishant has shifted from bowling no-balls to wide. 😂😛👊🏻😎😉#cricket #AUSvIND #IndvsAus #ODI
If you would like to explain the word #vain to new students of English, you could probably use rohit's effort as an example. #IndvsAus
And India fall short of 25-30 runs repeatedly! #AnotherLoss #IndvsAus
Pakistan Won & India Lost :) Awesome Day - Friday ;) #PAKvsNZ #AUSvsIND
Bad Luck Rohit! #INDvsAUS... https://t.co/4xtkv3KATK https://t.co/ndKkfZyIl5
One Aussie batsmen features in top 10 ODI rankings and they chase...Aussies have a star team unlike India with star players #AusvsInd
When will rohit stop hitting 100's and india starts winning its been long from dharmshala kanpur perth and now brisbane #IndvsAus
It's like, Dhoni comes in and the team loses all aggression. When is the board chucking him out? #IndvsAus
With a bowling attack like ours, I reckon 375+ is a safe score. Anything less would be too easy for Aussies. #IndvsAus
Another magnificent ton wasted by our Lacklustre bowlers #IndvsAus.
Dhoni is still miles behind the legend Saurav Ganguly in captainship.. To be a better Captain win abroad and show. #IndvsAus
Dhoni is the best tranquilizer ever. #IndvsAus
India lost but u @ImRo45 won many hearts...#IndvsAus @BCCI @StarSportsIndia https://t.co/0YoTMAusiH
Take a bow @ImRo45 what an amazing knock👏👏 A delight to watch👌Keep it up👍 #IndvsAus
Dhoni complains more than a pissed of teenager.. #IndvsAus
The only thing in this series that India has won so far is the toss! 💪💪😂 #IndvsAus
I have no qualms in saying #Ashwin is an ordinary & overrated bowler. He is an awful bowler who had got more than desired chances! #IndvsAus
It's an open secret that MSD keeps Jadeja & #Ashwin in all formats regardless of how bad they perform. Or how well others do #IndvsAus
@India_AllSports @rohanbopanna RT it: #INDvsAUS Match under suspicion hint of Fixing-> https://t.co/Bli1HzecYz
Today i felt Like i was watching Highlights of Last Match . #AUSvsIND #Rohitsharma Performance is inversaly... https://t.co/vnsh9XGITV
India has found a new and a better sachin tendulkar #RohitSharma #IndvsAus
Got to feel for Rohit Sharma.Last 4 times he's scored a hundred his team has lost.He's teammates better up their game now.#AUSvIND #IndvsAus
Another 100 for Rohit Another 50 for Kohli Another 300+ for Ind Another awesome show by Bailey & Smith Another laugh for Aus #IndvsAus
#IndvsAus any word is nothing to say about rohit sharma he is the best player to team India...
Ishant Sharma should be made captain so that he can drop himself easily #IndvsAus
Ishant Sharma's #OddEvenFormula On odd days, he drops catches. On even days, he is dropped. #IndvsAus
In criticizing Ishant Sharma... people shud not forget Ashwin who's equal partner in today's loss in #IndvsAus Both r experienced bowlers.
Todayyy....was sooo gorgious #IndvsAus Supported n support India
Poor captaincy & another 'spin'eless bowling effort. If #Ashwin can take wickets with new ball in Tests, he can do it in ODIs too. #IndvsAus
India lost again...due to ..#IndvsAus
Meanwhile #IndianMedia is trying very hard to find any excuse to blame Pakistan and #ISI for humiliating defeat against Australia😂 #IndvsAus
#IndvsAus Gurkirat is a hard hitting batsmen & also a handy off spinner too. He has a good domestic season behind with the ball too. 2/2
Blue Rohit Sharma is in great touch ......u knw what I mean if u follow Indian cricket #indvsaus
Bad man manager @msdhoni criticizing his bowlers publicly. Why would anyone want to help him in the fightback? #IndvsAus
Man of the match goes to .... #RohitSharma !!! #Congratulations #IndvsAus https://t.co/3z3PODnWW3
Well Played @ImRo45 .. #MOM #AUSvsIND
Dunno why #Indian captains play politics with players careers? Case in point..@msdhoni with Rishi Dhawan.. smh #IndvsAus #cricket
I don't think Australia have done anything worth to deserve the win in both matches ! #AUSvsIND #SochoJeetKi
#IndvsAus india's lost hero is ishant sharma.easily drop catch.i think i catch those ball.
Indian politics has Kejriwal, Indian cricket team has Dhoni #IndvsAus
@msdhoni has a bright future in #Indian politics post retirement.. :P #IndvsAus #India #cricket
sack dhawan get ashish nehra and yuvi back to the team also give chance to irfan pathan I don't get dhoni's blind trust on jadeja #IndvsAus
It's seems like the match is not between #IndvsAus , But between Indian batsmen vs Indian bowlers 😖
Still not over. India can win the series 3-2 #IndvsAus
Send Rahane or Manish Pandey to open with Rohit. Bring in Rishi Dhawan at 6. Team won't do worse than what they are doing now. #IndvsAus
Shikhar Dhawan's biography should be named ' Playing it Shahid Afridi's way' #IndvsAus #AUSvIND
When @imVkohli gives confidence to each player, @msdhoni brings it down. Too stubborn to try things.#IndvsAus https://t.co/SfZM2LQBIo
Without Sachin , yuvi , zaheer, gambhir ,bhajji, sehwag we are nothing . India will loose 0-5 #IndvsAus
So many quality fast bowlers you have! #AUSvIND #IndvsAus https://t.co/qwwi1BydJK
For dhawan its a test match #IndvsAus
#IndvsAus with this runrate we never going 2 make 330 n with our bowling line up we are never going to win
@ImRo45 scores ton, India loses. Today he is out cheap. Is that a sign of change of luck for Team India #AUSvsIND
Rohit Sharma gone early..Now Indians are in with a really good chance to win😂 #AUSvsIND
Rohit Sharma out. Not so good, this morning. @ICCLive #IndvsAus
Australia have been bowling really well so far #AUSvsIND https://t.co/I33XyDnC2v
Rohit sharma is back to his form. All he needs is consistency now. #talent #IndvsAus
#AusvsInd india lost toss & lost rohit as 1st wkt hope 2day ind will win
Rohit Sharma Is out, Kohli wont be Run out today for sure #IndVsAus
Tough pitch agree with jones here 270 280 shd be good #indvsaus #goforitindia @SparxGoForIt
Talent has got out early today, so may be India will win today #IndvsAus
Harsha Bhogle after Shikhar Dhawan Shot: When was the last time you saw a pull to third man! :D Trolling at its best. #IndvsAus
Either Kohli is selfish or Dhawan is half fit. #IndvsAus
Dhawan as a opener lacks basic batting skills i.e. Rotating strike #IndvsAus
Congrats @imVkohli on becomin d fastest to reach 7000 ODI runs in the history of #ODI #Cricket by beating @ABdeVilliers17 @BCCI #IndvsAus
Shikhar Dhawan has been pushed to do some work in his in-laws' place. Thats why such good batting. #IndvsAus
100 up for India #IndvsAus #BleedBlue
#INDvsAUS Today's #Prophecy India will win this Match :)
Kohli finds the fence again to beat the man in the deep #AusvsInd
Virat you beauty! #AUSvsIND
@ajith27 india is gonna win...Rohit got out early! 😂 #IndvsAus
#IndvsAus SHOT!! SHOT!!! SHOT!! KOHLI KOHLI... Cuts the ball away... beats the man at deep point.. FOUR!! INDIA 100/1
Seems 280 Is Impossible 😯#IndvsAus
Virat Kohli's running between the wickets resembles an Angry Bird Projectile, WHY NOT STRAIGHT. #IndvsAus
If it had been rohit there instead of shikhar virat would have been run out by now #IndvsAus
Just dont run yourself out V. #AusvsInd
Faulkner behaving foolner...waking up sleeping tiger #kohli...run rate start picking #IndvsAus
Faulkner is so annoyed rn oh god 😹 #IndvsAus
Rahane meanwhile trying for an uppercut, almost broke his back bone. #IndvsAus
I love the way faulkner has beat the batsmen starting from off reaching close to the wicket #IndvsAus
Dont blame bowlers, blame batsmen for score so slow on flat wickets like this. #IndvsAus
India's answer to the prob of Shikhar Dhawan is to get one more Dhawan #IndvsAus #GoForItIndia @SparxGoForIt
Below 300 India can defend, above 300 they cant... #IndvsAus
Not A Good Time To Send Debutant Gurkeerat Singh. Should Have Sent Experienced Sir Jadeja. #IndvsAus #AUSvIND
People with the mindset of Bill Lowry are what will keep One Day cricket from progressing into a more entertaining game #IndvsAus
Dhoni Slapping Hard On His Hater's Face. #IndvsAus #AUSvIND
love it how everyone curses dhoni for everything but when the going gets tough and india needs a boost it's all DHONI DHONI! #AUSVSIND
#IndvsAus WICKET! India lose @msdhoni. India 288/6 https://t.co/NlqRvrelXO https://t.co/fAcnXLdQBY" #Amazingman
#AUSvIND we don't have Ashwin in the team so add 15 to the total for our good fielding #IndvsAus
Too many freebies by Indian bowlers, especially Umesh Yadav... #AUSvIND #IndvsAus
It's not the batsmen but Ishant Sharma whose performance will decide the result. #IndvsAus
7 runs could have been stopped so far... 3 and 4 #IndvsAus @StarSportsIndia
Its 2016 and Australian players still taking 3s. #IndvsAus
1st match: 309 runs 2nd match: 308 runs 3rd match: 295 runs Indian team is too serious about odd even formula. #IndvsAus
As usual India are 30-40 runs short, Australia should win it by 48th over. #IndvsAus
Pity on India bowling lineup. #IndvsAus #3rdODI Nobody looks like wicket taking bowlers. Trying to finish thier quota.
#AusvInd #IndvsAus will this be another walk in the park for Aussie?
It's painful to see India lose with such a ease after scoring close to 300... Indian bowling RIP #IndvsAus
Rishi Dhawan has bowled more variations in 4 overs than Ishant Sharma, Yadav and Sran combined in the whole series.. #IndvsAus
Some people predicted the win only because the person who scored a ton wasn't rohit sharma #IndvsAus
Australia are going at over 6 runs per over with out taking any risk. With this kind of bowling attack we at least need 330-340. #IndvsAus
What happened to Australian pitches .... #IndvsAus
India needs to put stress on its bowlers to win this as well as the rest matches in the series #IndvsAus
Today India and Pakistan going to lose together. Long live their friendship😂😂 #ausvind #nzvpak #NZvPAK #IndvsAus
Rishi Dhawan and Gurkeerat bowling..time to take a nap.. #IndvsAus
Jaddu last HOPE..never thought I l be tweeting this one day #AUSvsIND
Disappointing to see Indian bowlers not having figured the three Aussie batsmen. #IndVsAus
Why is Dhoni blamed..blame the idiot bowlers .. #INDvsAUS
When bowlers like @IrfanPathan is sitting home&we keep experimenting with newbies on international level,such a show is expected #IndvsAus
@msdhoni trying every possible option, aussies laughing over such ridiculous bowling attack #IndvsAus
Shastri: Is 300 a good score ? Dhoni: It is defendable if we bowl and field well Ishant: I think we are about 100 short #IndvsAus
Taking Jajeda off right after S.Marsh's wicket is proving to be very costly! #IndvsAus https://t.co/XqFhfYb8oJ https://t.co/JDMONfn9rw
Poor cricket all around... Can't blame Dhoni for fucking bowling and fielding stuff... #IndvsAus
#IndvsAus good thing abt game we r losing at MCG is Ind will avoid being the only team who hv allowed 300+ to be chased down thrice in a row
#indvsaus unless we v bwlrs who can bowl 6 good balls consistently, wthut gvng out ec hit me balls in btwn, winning will be a dream @BCCI
Umesh Yadav sends dick pics to Maxwell. #AUSvsIND
It's time to get rid of all Sharmas in the team. #IndvsAus
Umesh Yadav just bowled an over that sums up the problem in Indian bowling. Mindless crap!! #IndvsAus
#IndvsAus it's just frustrating to see we keep on losing because of our pathetic non existent bowling so called greats.
Bharat Ratna should be given to MS Dhoni just for dealing with Indian bowlers all these years. #IndvsAus
Ishant sharma is tryng 2 copy zlatan today, but I guess he didn't see a mirror before going out to play #IndvsAus
This is so disappointing. Ugh. #IndvsAus
Now its 25 need in 24 balls . It seems that India is going to loose the series . #IndVsAus
We badly lost the series!!#AusvsInd
It's very simple. #sackdhoni & u wud see ind winning #IndvsAus
#AUSvsIND- Run Out Chance Missed! @imjadeja shied at the stumps but missed, the batsman would've been out
Really frustrating.. i mean really #IndvsAus 😢😢😢😢
Ishant and Umesh had to be dropped. Not Ashwin. They are neither economical nor taking wickets. #IndvsAus
Batsmen keep breaking records and bowlers keep giving it away ! #IndianCricket #IndvsAus
Umesh Yadav fucked that up so badly. A very very strange decision. #IndvsAus
There is not any captain as stupid as mahendra singh dhoni, his captaincy has single handedly lost us the series. bcci is blind #IndvsAus
These Indian bowlers will never learn #IndvsAus
Pak lost, but then Kashmiri's have a bonus of India losing. #IndvsAus #Kashmir
I want @msdhoni to quit captaincy. Can't see the bowlers failing terribly every time and Dhoni shouldering all the responsibility. #IndvsAus
This Shikhar Dhawan is as useless as 'ueue' in Queue. #IndvsAus #DropDhawan
Rain has delayed the thrashing of Bangladesh team however, stay tuned if you want to see Bangladesh team decimated #AsiaCupT20Final
