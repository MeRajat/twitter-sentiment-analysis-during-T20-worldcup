You know @apple It's been almost a week since I paid for iTunes Match, I would really like to use it. Any ETA on a fix?
@Mayati I think @Apple didn't do such a thorough job with the step x steps for upgrade and move to iCloud. Now it's cost me mightily.
Damn you @apple for breaking wififofum! It continued to work in ios 4. Was one of my most used apps. Damn Apple's overbearing policies!
